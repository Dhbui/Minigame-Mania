Minesweeper-
Use the mode switcher to flip between Marking and Revealing. 
Reveal Mode is equivalent to left click in regular Minesweeper. Use it to check squares you think are clear.
Mark Mode is equivalent to right click in regular Minesweeper. Click once to flag, again to mark for review, and a third time to clear. 
Careful! Just because you flagged the mine doesn't mean you can't set it off!
Too easy? Increase the difficulty by making your field larger or increase the probability of a square being a bomb in the options! Make sure to hit the save button or your settings won't change! Race against the timer to beat your friends!
